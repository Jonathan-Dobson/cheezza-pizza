Hi I'm jonathan. I'm a react developer. I decided to try something new by challenging myself to reproduce an online ordering setup similar little caesars.com. I just started this project and I'm sure it will take weeks or even months to make a complete ordering system. Nonetheless, I'd like to share what I have so far. Here is the beginning of my pizza website I named cheezapizza. Its built with react and redux and currently running on my localhost.
